## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/innovations-dev/boiler15.git my-app
cd my-app
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up third-party services:

- [ ] You'll need to create a database. We're currently using [Turso](https://turso.tech/) for this. We'd be open to solving for other providers as well, if this project happens to be used by others.
- [ ] You'll need a [Resend](https://resend.com) account as well.
- [ ] You'll need a `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from any third-party social/Oauth services you plan to use.

4. Set up your environment variables:

We use [@t3-oss/env](https://github.com/t3-oss/env) to manage and secure your environment variables.
You can find the example `.env.sample` file in the root of the repository.

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

> **NOTE:** BetterAuth seems to look specifically for a .env file. If you know of a better way to get it to also respect the next.js convention of .env.local, please let us know.

```bash
App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your_verification_code
Auth
BETTER_AUTH_URL=your_auth_url
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
Email
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=your_email@domain.com
TEST_EMAIL=test@example.com
Database
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=your_turso_url
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_turso_token
```

5. Initialize the database:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`
