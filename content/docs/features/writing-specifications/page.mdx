# Writing Technical Specifications

## Overview

This guide provides a framework for writing technical specifications for different types of features, changes, and improvements. It covers various scenarios from small feature additions to large-scale refactors and system architecture changes.

## Fundamentals of Specification Writing

### Why Write Specifications?

1. **Alignment & Communication**

   - Ensure all stakeholders understand the goals and approach
   - Create a shared understanding of the problem and solution
   - Facilitate meaningful technical discussions
   - Enable early feedback and course correction

2. **Risk Management**

   - Identify potential issues early in development
   - Consider edge cases and failure modes
   - Plan for security and scalability
   - Document assumptions and constraints

3. **Project Success**
   - Set clear expectations and success criteria
   - Define scope and boundaries
   - Create a reference for implementation
   - Enable accurate estimation and planning

### When to Write a Specification?

```typescript
interface SpecificationTrigger {
  complexity: "Low" | "Medium" | "High";
  impact: "Local" | "Cross-cutting" | "System-wide";
  audience: string[];
  timing: "Before Planning" | "During Planning" | "Before Implementation";
}

const specificationGuidelines: Record<string, SpecificationTrigger> = {
  "New Feature": {
    complexity: "Medium",
    impact: "Local",
    audience: ["Developers", "Product", "QA"],
    timing: "Before Implementation",
  },
  "System Refactor": {
    complexity: "High",
    impact: "System-wide",
    audience: ["Architects", "Developers", "Operations"],
    timing: "Before Planning",
  },
  "Performance Optimization": {
    complexity: "Medium",
    impact: "Cross-cutting",
    audience: ["Developers", "Operations"],
    timing: "During Planning",
  },
};
```

### How to Approach Specification Writing?

1. **Research Phase**

   ```typescript
   interface ResearchPhase {
     activities: {
       codebaseAnalysis: {
         existingPatterns: string[];
         painPoints: string[];
         dependencies: string[];
       };
       stakeholderInput: {
         requirements: string[];
         constraints: string[];
         preferences: string[];
       };
       marketResearch: {
         competitors: string[];
         bestPractices: string[];
         trends: string[];
       };
     };
     outputs: {
       findings: string[];
       recommendations: string[];
       openQuestions: string[];
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Planning Phase**

   ```typescript
   interface PlanningPhase {
     steps: {
       scopeDefinition: {
         included: string[];
         excluded: string[];
         future: string[];
       };
       stakeholderAlignment: {
         meetings: string[];
         decisions: string[];
         approvals: string[];
       };
       riskAssessment: {
         technical: string[];
         business: string[];
         mitigation: string[];
       };
     };
     outputs: {
       timeline: string;
       resources: string[];
       dependencies: string[];
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Writing Phase**
   ```typescript
   interface WritingPhase {
     approach: {
       iterative: boolean;
       collaborative: boolean;
       reviewDriven: boolean;
     };
     steps: {
       outline: string[];
       firstDraft: string[];
       review: string[];
       revision: string[];
       finalization: string[];
     };
     bestPractices: {
       structure: string[];
       clarity: string[];
       completeness: string[];
     };
   }
   ```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overspecification**

   - Too much detail in areas that need flexibility
   - Premature optimization
   - Over-engineering solutions

2. **Underspecification**

   - Missing critical requirements
   - Vague success criteria
   - Insufficient context

3. **Poor Scoping**

   - Unclear boundaries
   - Missing dependencies
   - Undefined non-goals

4. **Implementation Bias**
   - Jumping to solutions too quickly
   - Not considering alternatives
   - Ignoring constraints

### Managing Breaking Changes

1. **Pre-Change Analysis**

   - Document all existing behaviors thoroughly
   - Map out all dependencies (direct and indirect)
   - Identify all consumers of the system
   - Understand current data flows and patterns

2. **Change Classification**

   ```typescript
   interface ChangeAssessment {
     type: "Breaking" | "Non-Breaking" | "Potentially Breaking";
     scope: {
       apis: string[];
       dataSchemas: string[];
       behaviors: string[];
       dependencies: string[];
     };
     impact: {
       services: string[];
       consumers: string[];
       dataFlow: string[];
       performance: string[];
     };
     mitigation: {
       strategy: string;
       timeline: string;
       resources: string[];
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Stability Requirements**

   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Provide migration paths
   - Implement feature flags
   - Version APIs appropriately
   - Ensure data integrity
   - Plan for rollback

4. **Validation Strategy**

   ```typescript
   interface StabilityValidation {
     existingFunctionality: {
       behaviors: string[];
       testCases: string[];
       successCriteria: string[];
     };
     compatibility: {
       backwardCompatible: boolean;
       migrationPath: string;
       verificationSteps: string[];
     };
     monitoring: {
       metrics: string[];
       alerts: string[];
       thresholds: Record<string, number>;
     };
   }
   ```

5. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Use feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Implement proper versioning
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage
   - Monitor system behavior
   - Document all changes
   - Plan for graceful degradation
   - Consider cross-service dependencies
   - Test in production-like environments

### Keys to Success

1. **Clarity**

   - Use precise, unambiguous language
   - Define terms and acronyms
   - Include relevant context
   - Separate requirements from suggestions

2. **Completeness**

   - Cover all aspects of the change
   - Include non-functional requirements
   - Document assumptions
   - Address known limitations

3. **Collaboration**

   - Involve stakeholders early
   - Seek diverse perspectives
   - Incorporate feedback
   - Maintain open communication

4. **Practicality**
   - Keep it actionable
   - Focus on value
   - Consider constraints
   - Plan for iteration

## Types of Specifications

  impact: "internal", // user-facing | internal | both
  risk: "medium", // low | medium | high
};
```

### 3. API Specification

Used for defining new APIs or making changes to existing ones.

```typescript
// Example API Spec Structure
export const apiSpec = {
  type: "api",

  auth: "required",
};
```

### 4. Performance Improvement

## Conclusion

A well-written specification serves as both a planning document and a reference for implementation. It should be clear, comprehensive, and maintainable. Use these templates and guidelines as a starting point, and adapt them to your specific needs and organizational requirements.

Remember:

- Start with clear goals
- Be specific and detailed
- Include examples and code
- Consider all stakeholders
- Plan for maintenance
- Document assumptions
