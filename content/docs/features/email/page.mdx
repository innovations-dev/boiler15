Our email system uses [React Email](https://react.email) with [Resend](https://resend.com) for building and sending beautiful, type-safe transactional emails. Some email functionality is provided through Better-Auth plugins.

## Overview

- üìß **React Email**: Type-safe email templates with React
- üöÄ **Resend**: Modern email API for reliable delivery
- üé® **Tailwind CSS**: Styled components in emails
- üîç **Preview Mode**: Local development preview
- üì± **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly email templates
- üîí **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- üéØ **Error Handling**: Robust error management

## Authentication Emails

Some authentication-related emails are handled by Better-Auth plugins:

1. **Magic Link Emails**: Configured through the `magicLink` plugin in `lib/auth.ts`
2. **Verification Emails**: Handled by Better-Auth's email verification system
3. **Password Reset**: Managed through Better-Auth's password reset flow

## Custom Email Configuration

For custom emails (like organization invites), the system is configured in `lib/email/config.ts`:

```ts
export const emailConfig = {
  from: env.EMAIL_FROM,
  replyTo: env.EMAIL_FROM,
  baseUrl: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL,
  templates: {
    VERIFICATION: {
      subject: "Verify your email address",
    },
    RESET_PASSWORD: {
      subject: "Reset your password",
    },
    INVITATION: {
      subject: "You've been invited to join {organizationName}",
    },
  },
};
```

## Type Definitions

Our custom email system uses TypeScript for type safety:

```ts
export type EmailTemplate = "VERIFICATION" | "RESET_PASSWORD" | "INVITATION";

export interface EmailOptions {
  to: string;
  template: EmailTemplate;
  data: Record<string, unknown>;
}

export interface EmailResult {
  success: boolean;
  data?: unknown;
  error?: Error;
}
```

## Email Templates

   - Note: Integrated with Better-Auth's password reset functionality

### Organization Emails

1. **Invitation Email** (`emails/invitation.tsx`):
   - Purpose: Organization invitations
   - Features: Organization context, inviter information

## Usage Examples

### Sending Authentication Emails

```ts
// Verification Email
await sendEmail({
  to: user.email,
  template: "VERIFICATION",
  data: {
    verificationUrl,
    username: user.name,
  },
});

// Password Reset
await sendEmail({
  to: user.email,
  template: "RESET_PASSWORD",
  data: {
    resetUrl,
    username: user.name,
  },
});
```

### Sending Organization Invites

```ts
await sendEmail({
  to: inviteeEmail,
  template: "INVITATION",
  data: {
    inviteUrl,
    organizationName: org.name,
    inviterName: inviter.name,
  },
});
```

## Development

### Local Email Preview

Start the email preview server:

```bash
pnpm email:preview
```

This starts a local server at `http://localhost:3001` where you can preview your email templates.

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxx # Your Resend API key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com # Verified sender email
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com # Your app's URL
```
